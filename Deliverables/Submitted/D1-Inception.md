*The value proposition should make clear the value from the point of view of the customer. It should not be a slogan or a description of functionality. The value proposition and consumer segment should be coherent with the text in the previous section; in particular, the value should address the problem reported above (problem-solution fit). The customer segment should not be too broad or too specific.*

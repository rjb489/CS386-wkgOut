# Tests

# Demo

# Code Quality
One of the first decisions that we made as a group was on was code style guidelines that we all agreed made code easier to read in order to make it easier for anyone to work on. The guidelines that we decided on were inspired heavily by Dr. Michael Leverington's G.U.R.; we all took his class the previous semester, and it was something that we all knew and agreed would make reading easy. Not only was this something that was still fresh in our minds, so we did not need to waste any time learning a new way to code, but we had spent that past semester being graded on our code's ability to follow the G.U.R., so we knew it was something that we could do. This has led us to have clean, readable, and, most importantly, efficient code in our project.

# Lessons Learned
Our group learned a lot during this next phase of implementation. First and foremost on the technical side, we learned and improved on valuable skills in coding languages such as HTML, JavaScript, MySQL, and Node.js. We also ran into some issues with our database, so the people that the team had assigned to work on the database were forced to become proficient not only in hosting a database server but also in node.js to link our JavaScript to said database. Learning how to do this also taught us in the group the soft skills of researching any unknown topics and applying them to what we were working on. No matter what we do, this is a skill that will always be helpful in any field, so it is a good thing that we were able to pick it up. Lastly, learning all of these different technologies and putting them all together while each working on a different part of the project helped us bring our communication as a group to another level. If we had had the same quality of communication that we used as the first implementation deliverable, we would have been in a lot of trouble.

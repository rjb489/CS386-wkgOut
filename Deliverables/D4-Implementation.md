# Introduction
A web app that is designed to help people who enjoy working out. wkgOut is a journaling/scheduling webpage that allows gym goers to have more efficient and less injury-prone gym going experiences through the use of a gym scheduler that can both build unique gym schedules and provide schedule presets. The main features of this software include being able to build, share, and use other workouts as well as track and reflect on these sessions in the journal session.

# Tests

# Adopted Technologies
AWS for deployment, MySql for database, HTML for web page creation, CSS for web page design, Javascript for functionality.

# Learning / Training
We decided to find a free platform to help us deploy our website and we have heard very good things about it so that is why we decided to use AWS. We used MySql as the majority of us are taking CS345 which introduces us to MySql so we knew how to incorporate that software for databases. Lastly, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the most well known languages to create websites and we are all fluent from previous classes so we decided to do that as well.

# Deployment
We are using Amplify by AWS to deploy our website. Using Amplify, we can directly connect our GitHub repo, which also allows for continuous deployment. The link is [HERE](https://main.d3c2e2m3rl6sk8.amplifyapp.com). We will update the domain later if necessary.

# Licensing

# Look & Feel
MINUKA DO THIS ONE

# Lessons Learned
Our team learned how to start an AWS and how to work with it to deploy our website and linking all of the pages together. For the second release we will be able to deploy our website almost instantly as we have learned how to do that.

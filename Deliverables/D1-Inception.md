# **Introduction**
A web app that is designed to help people who enjoy working out build, share, track, and reflect on workout sessions. wkgOut is a journaling and workout tracking tool that allows users to build workouts from pre-sets or original ideas, and use a journaling system to document and/or reflect on sessions. The work out building tool will also feature the ability to share the workout with other users.

*The Assignment: describe in one paragraph what your project is about. Make it clear what problem your software is solving and the context of the solution.*
*Everyone Take a Look and Add to this Introduction Accordingly!*

# **Initial Value Proposition & Customer Segment**

*The value proposition should make clear the value from the point of view of the customer. It should not be a slogan or a description of functionality. The value proposition and consumer segment should be coherent with the text in the previous section; in particular, the value should address the problem reported above (problem-solution fit). The customer segment should not be too broad or too specific.*

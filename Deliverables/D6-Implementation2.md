# Code Quality

# Lessons Learned
Our group learned a lot during this next phase of implementation. First and foremost on the technical side, we learned and improved on valuable skills in coding languages such as HTML, JavaScript, MySQL, and Node.js. We also ran into some issues with our database, so the people that the team had assigned to work on the database were forced to become proficient not only in hosting a database server but also in node.js to link our JavaScript to said database. Learning how to do this also taught us in the group the soft skills of researching any unknown topics and applying them to what we were working on. No matter what we do, this is a skill that will always be helpful in any field, so it is a good thing that we were able to pick it up. Lastly, learning all of these different technologies and putting them all together while each working on a different part of the project helped us bring our communication as a group to another level. If we had had the same quality of communication that we used as the first implementation deliverable, we would have been in a lot of trouble.

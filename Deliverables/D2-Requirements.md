# **Stakeholders**

*Make a list of all stakeholders of the project with a brief description of each one of them, emphasizing any responsibilities with the project. Examples of stakeholders include users, clients, competitors, detractors, developers, etc. Grading criteria (1 point): The stakeholders can’t be too generic or specific. The list should reflect what was described in Section 1.*


---

# **Functional Requirements**

*Make a numbered list of requirements for your software. Just self-explanatory titles are enough at this point. Remember that requirements should deliver the value proposition and they must be consistent with the interviews you performed for the previous deliverable. You can talk again to your clients to help define the requirements. While writing the requirements, focus on the capabilities needed and not on how they should be implemented. Grading criteria (2 points): The list should be comprehensive (remember that you are not expected to implement all the requirements by the end of the course but you should list them). Follow the same pattern to describe all the requirements. The list of requirements should be coherent with the previous sections.*


---

# **Non-Functional Requirements**

*Make a numbered list of non-functional requirements that are important for your software. Explain their importance. Follow the terminology of ISO/IEC 25010:2011. For each non-functional requirement, give an objective goal/measurement in order to provide verifiability for the requirement. You can find more details at the following URL: [Click Me](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8559686). Grading criteria (2 points): Follow the ISO-IEC terminology, explain why they are important, provide verifiability criteria for each requirement.*

# **MVP**

*What will be your MVP? Which features are you going to validate? How? Grading criteria (2 points): Describe what would be considered the Minimal Viable Product and how it will be tested (e.g., via implementation, prototyping, Wizard of Woz, etc.). Make clear what you are going to validate. The MVP should be coherent with the previous sections.*

# **Use Case**

*Use case diagram*

*Include a UML use case diagram for your project. There are many drawing tools that you can use, such as [Me!](https://app.diagrams.net/Links) and [Me2!](https://creately.com/Links)*

*Grading criteria (5 points): Follow correctly the UML specification. The actors should be coherent with what was listed in sections 1 and 2. The use case diagram should be coherent with the list of requirements (section 3). The level of granularity of each use case should be adequate. The use cases should be adequately named.*

*Use case descriptions and interface sketch*

*Present one complete use case description for each member of the group. Therefore, if the group has 4 members, 4 use case descriptions are necessary. As the grading will not be individual, the group is responsible for keeping the quality and consistency of the whole document – avoid just splitting the work. Choose the most important use cases to describe. Follow the template provided in the Lecture slides to describe the use cases.*

*After each use case description, add a sketch of the corresponding user interface. This will be a good opportunity to start thinking about usability.*

*Grading criteria (8 points): Follow the template to describe the use cases. Present an interface sketch for each use case. Describe the use case as a dialog between the user and the system. Do not use UI language in the description of the use case.*

    - Use Case: Build Workout
    - Actor: User
    - Trigger: User selects "Build Workout"
    - Pre-Condition: User is registered and has an account
    - Post-Condition: User has access to a workout they built
    - Success Scenario:
        - User selects "Build Workout"
        - User is prompted to place "Exercises"
        - User picks the amount of reps and sets
        - User can add more or finish the build
        - User can access the workout to edit later

    - Alternate Scenario:
        - User selects "Build Workout"
        - User selects to create exercise (one that isn't a preset)
        - User inputs necessary information
        - User can add more or finish the build
        - The newly created exercise is saved to the user's profile for future use
        - User can access the workout to edit later

# **User Stores**

*Write two user stories for each member of the group. They can be related to the same features described in the use cases or to different ones. Adopt the following format: "As a <ROLE>, I want <SOMETHING> so that <GOAL>." Establish a priority level for each user story and estimate how many hours each one will demand using the planning poker approach. Grading criteria (6 points): Use the provided format. The user stories should be in an adequate level of granularity (not too broad nor too specific). Provide the priority and estimation for each user story.*

    - As a workout planner, I want to have the ability to share workouts I build, so I can help my team with consistent workouts.
        - Priority Level: 3
        - Time Estimate: 3 Hours

    - As someone who works out, I want to be able to build my own workout plans, so that I can be more efficient in my workouts.
        - Priority Level: 1
        - Time Estimate: 6 Hours
